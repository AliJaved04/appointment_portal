# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Flow 
## Login 
The landing page of the project is login page in which user will put its credentials in order to get authenticated and get access to the dashboard. The login component is calling the post api of authentication in order to get authenticated and recieve access token from the server.

## Dashboard
The dashboard component consists of navbar component which majorly contains a logo and a logout button to terminate current running session. The dashboard also contains Appointment Component.

## Appointment Component 
The appointment component will render the data of all the appointments in tabular from in respective day and timeslot. The data used in this component is recieved from dashboard component as props. And in dashboard component this data is fetched through the appointments API. The dashboard component also passed a hanlder named `contentRefresh` to child component to refresh the current token and re render the data after refetching it.



## Node Version
v20.10.0

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
